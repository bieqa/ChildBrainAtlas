Infant and Child Brain Atlas

This brain atlas, including T2/T1, DWI images, and resting-functional MRI, were created based on large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) and Bayesian atlas estimation approaches [1,2]. When creating the atlases, we combined the two approaches and integrated both T2 and tensor information of infants and children at birth, 6 months, 4.5 years, 6 years, and 7.5 years. The atlas at each age includes structural, diffusion, and functional images as well as brain functional and deep white matter tract parcellation labels.
The structural image (T1/T2) and diffusion image (DTI) show coherent gray and white matter structures. The label image includes both functional and white matter tract parcellation.
