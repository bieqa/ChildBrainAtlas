Neonate and Child Brain Atlas

This brain atlases, including T2/T1 and DWI images, were created based on large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) and Bayesian atlas estimation approaches [1,2]. When creating the atlases, we combined the two approaches and integrated both T2 and tensor information of 30 neonatal brains and 60 child brains. The atlas at each age includes structural and diffusion images as well as brain parcellation labels.
The structural image (T1/T2) and diffusion image (DTI) show coherent gray and white matter structures. The label image includes both gray and white matter tract parcellation.
